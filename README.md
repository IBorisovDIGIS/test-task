Develop a React SPA application for managing promo codes. The SPA should be written in Typescript, based on the following proposed layout and include the following functionality:

Ability to filter services by name.
Ability to reset filters.
Ability to copy promo code to the clipboard.
Ability to change service status to “Activated” by clicking on “Activate bonus” button.

You can imitate API by using this JSON.

Your solution would stand out if you cover your code with e2e or/and unit tests.

The project should be built with webpack and include a README.md with instructions on how to run it locally.

Please push your results to GitHub and send us the link to the repository.

Added bonus: add localization for multi language support.
